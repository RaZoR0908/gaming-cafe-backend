# Data Synchronization Solution

## Problem Description

The system had a data synchronization issue where when a user's booked session ended (duration ran out), the system's status was not automatically updated in the database. This caused discrepancies between the admin panel and the user-facing app.

### Incorrect Behavior Flow:
1. User books PC01 for 1 hour ‚Üí System status becomes "Active"
2. After 1 hour, session ends ‚Üí Booking marked as "Completed"
3. **Bug**: PC01 status remains "Active" instead of becoming "Available"
4. **Consequences**: 
   - Admin dashboard shows PC01 as "Active" with "Expired" timer
   - System unavailable for new bookings in customer app

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Backend Cron Job (Node.js/Express)

**File**: `services/cronService.js`

- **Technology**: Uses `node-cron` package for reliable scheduling
- **Frequency**: Runs every minute (`* * * * *`)
- **Functionality**: 
  - Queries bookings collection for active sessions
  - Checks if `sessionEndTime` has passed current time
  - Updates expired bookings to "Completed" status
  - Updates corresponding systems to "Available" status
  - Sets `activeBooking` to `null`

**Key Features**:
- Robust error handling for individual bookings
- Detailed logging for monitoring and debugging
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Manual sync trigger capability

### 2. Database Update Logic (Mongoose/MongoDB)

**Atomic Updates Performed**:

```javascript
// 1. Update booking status
booking.status = 'Completed';

// 2. Update system status and clear active booking
system.status = 'Available';
system.activeBooking = null;
```

**Collections Updated**:
- `bookings`: Status changed from "Active" to "Completed"
- `systems` (embedded in cafe document): Status changed from "Active" to "Available"

### 3. Frontend Logic (React)

**File**: `owner-panel-web/src/components/SystemManagementModal.js`

**End Time Column Logic**:
- **Available Systems**: Display single dash (`-`)
- **Active Systems**: 
  - Show end time (e.g., "11:00 AM")
  - Display remaining time countdown
  - Show progress bar
- **Expired Active Systems**: Show "Expired" (rare due to cron job)

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints Added:

1. **Health Check with Cron Status**
   ```
   GET /health
   Response: { status: 'OK', cronJob: { isRunning, nextRun } }
   ```

2. **Manual Sync Trigger**
   ```
   POST /api/sync-sessions
   Response: { success: true, message: 'Manual sync completed' }
   ```

### Enhanced Endpoints:

1. **Auto-Complete Sessions** (existing, enhanced)
   ```
   POST /api/bookings/auto-complete-sessions
   Response: { success: true, message: 'X sessions auto-completed, Y systems freed' }
   ```

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install node-cron
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

### 3. Start the Service
```bash
npm start
```

The cron job will automatically start and run every minute.

## Testing

### 1. Test Cron Service
```bash
cd backend
node test-sync.js
```

### 2. Manual Sync Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/sync-sessions
```

### 3. Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

## Monitoring & Logging

### Console Logs
The service provides detailed logging:
- üïê Cron job started
- üîÑ Running session sync
- üìã Found X expired sessions
- üîÑ System X status updated
- üíæ Cafe X updated
- ‚úÖ Session X completed
- üéØ Sync completed summary

### Health Monitoring
- Endpoint: `/health`
- Shows cron job status and next run time
- Useful for monitoring service health

## Error Handling

### Robust Error Handling
- Individual booking processing errors don't stop the entire sync
- Detailed error logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation if database operations fail

### Graceful Shutdown
- Handles SIGTERM and SIGINT signals
- Stops cron job before process exit
- Prevents data corruption

## Performance Considerations

### Database Operations
- Uses efficient MongoDB queries with indexes
- Processes bookings in batches
- Minimal database writes (only when necessary)

### Memory Management
- No memory leaks from cron job
- Proper cleanup on shutdown
- Efficient object handling

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Configurable Intervals**: Allow different sync frequencies
2. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple cafes simultaneously
3. **Metrics Collection**: Track sync performance and success rates
4. **Alerting**: Notify administrators of sync failures
5. **Retry Logic**: Implement retry mechanism for failed updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cron Job Not Running**
   - Check console logs for startup messages
   - Verify `node-cron` installation
   - Check `/health` endpoint

2. **Systems Not Updating**
   - Verify booking has `sessionEndTime` field
   - Check MongoDB connection
   - Review console logs for errors

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor database query performance
   - Check for large numbers of expired sessions
   - Review MongoDB indexes

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by checking console output for:
- Session sync timing
- Database operation results
- Error details

## Conclusion

This solution provides a robust, automated way to keep system statuses synchronized with booking durations. The cron job runs every minute, ensuring minimal delay between session expiration and system availability updates. The frontend properly displays the current status, eliminating the discrepancy between admin panel and customer app.
